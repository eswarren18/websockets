## Purpose

This repository exists to learn about and implement WebSockets. It is built off of a forked repository of a React-based trivia game.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/eswarren18/websockets.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd websockets
   ```
3. Open the repository in your code editor (e.g., VS Code):
   ```sh
   code .
   ```
4. Build the Docker containers:
   ```sh
   docker compose build
   ```
5. Start the containers:
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
6. In your browser, open multiple windows or tabs and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/chat
   ```
   You can now chat with yourself across different windows using WebSockets.
